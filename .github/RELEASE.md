# Release Process

This document provides a comprehensive guide on the steps to execute a release for our project.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the release process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Commit messages must adhere to the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Proper permissions are in place to create and manage releases.

## Steps

### 1. Create Release

1. **Merge Pull Request to appropriate branch:**
   - Ensure that the changes intended for release are encapsulated in a Pull Request.
   - Merge the approved Pull Request into the `main` or `ethers-v5` branch. Currently, only the `main` and `ethers-v5` branches are allowed for releasing.

2. **Automatic Versioning with `Publish packages to github` Action:**
   - The `Publish packages to github` GitHub Action automates versioning based on conventional commit messages.
   - Upon merging the Pull Request, `Publish packages to github` will analyze commit messages, determine the next version, update changelog, and generate a new Pull Request containing version information.

3. **Merge Versioning Pull Request:**
   - Review and merge the Pull Request generated by `Publish packages to github`.
   - This action triggers the automatic creation of a new git tag and release.

### 2. Publish Release to NPM

1. **Manual Execution of `Publish packages to npm` Action:**
   - To publish packages to npm, manually initiate the `Publish packages to npm` GitHub Action.
   - Click on the `Run workflow` button and select the desired branch, plugin, and tag for publishing. Currently, only the `main` and `ethers-v5` branches are allowed for publishing.

2. **Workflow Execution:**
   - After selecting the appropriate configuration, click `Run workflow` to execute the action.
   - The action builds and publishes the package to npm.

3. **Completion Confirmation:**
   - Verify the successful completion of the workflow execution.
   - The package is now published to npm, and users can access the updated version.
